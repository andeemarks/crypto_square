# CryptoSquare

This is an Elixir implementation of a simple encoding algorithm called Crypto Square.

Just to make the implementation more "interesting" (i.e., needlessly complicated), I've split the parts of the algorithm across multiple Elixir processes :-)

## Running the tests

`mix test`

## Running the code (with canned input)

`iex -S mix`

Note: this command executes the code in `runner.ex`
